### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

### Key Features

*   ***Code Editor:*** A fully functional code editor with syntax highlighting and other essential features.
*   ***Integrated Terminal:*** Access a terminal directly from your web browser.
*   ***File System Explorer:*** Easily navigate and manage your project files.
*   ***Lightweight:*** No local installations required, making it accessible from any device with a web browser.

### Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anshgupta517/cloud-ide.git
    cd cloud-ide
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies & run server:**

    ```bash
    cd client && npm install && npm run dev
    cd ../server && npm install && nodemon index.js
    ```



    This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port).  Check the console output for the exact address.

### Usage

Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided. You should see the cloud-ide interface.  From there, you can:

*   Create, open, and edit files.
*   Run commands in the integrated terminal.
*   Navigate your project's file system.

**Explanation of Key Directories:**

*   **`client/`:**  Contains the frontend code, built with React and Vite.  It includes components for the terminal, file tree, and error handling.  `socket.js` handles communication with the backend server.
*   **`server/`:** Contains the backend code, built with Node.js and Express.  `index.js` is the main server file. 

### Technologies Used

*   [React](https://reactjs.org/) (Frontend)
*   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (Frontend Build Tool)
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Backend)
*   [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (Backend Framework)
*   [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) (Real-time communication)
*   [@xterm/xterm](https://xtermjs.org/) (Terminal emulator library - used in the terminal component)
*   [react-ace](https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace) (Code editor component)
*   [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) (File system watcher)
*   [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
*   [node-pty](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty) (Pseudo-terminal manager)

*Note: This list may be incomplete and will be updated as the project evolves.*
